Additional Rules to Avoid Silly Mistakes

Dependency Check:

Confirm that all required dependencies are installed and up-to-date (check your package.json and lock files).
Run npm install to resolve any missing packages if needed.
Environment Validation:

Ensure you are operating in the correct environment (development, staging, production).
Double-check environment variables and configuration files before executing commands.
Command Context:

Verify that you’re running commands in the appropriate directory to prevent path-related issues.
Use terminal history or scripts to avoid duplicate executions.
Error Handling:

Review error logs immediately if a command fails, rather than retrying blindly.
Document and resolve recurring errors to improve workflow efficiency.
UI Consistency:

For UI elements (like vim themes or maximize buttons), ensure that changes are connected to the correct components.
Test UI changes in isolation to verify smooth integration with existing functionality.
